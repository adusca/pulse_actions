"""
This module is for the following use case:

 - Automatic backfilling:

    * If we use pulse_actions to listen to mozilla-inbound finished
      *test* jobs, we should be able to re-trigger a job a couple of
      times (similar to what trigger bot does on try) and backfill
      back to the last known good

    * Notice that trigger bot has conditions on when to stop
      re-triggering more than needed
